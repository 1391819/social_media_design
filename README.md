  <h1>UnI: University Social Media</h1>

</div>

<div align="justify">

## About

One of the most important problems in our time is the fact that social media makes people less social, especially with regards to younger generations. Moreover, a lot of teenagers have trouble making new friends at one of the most valuable moments in their life: the start of their university journey. This application could potentially help solving both problems at the same time by encouraging university students to engage more in social activities, meet new people and make new experiences.

This repository contains a high-level prototype of a social media application that based on each user's schedule automatically organises and suggests local meet-ups and events. The main purpose of the system is to facilitate more meaningful social encounters between students based on location, university and hobbies.

### Differences from other social medias

1. It doesn't let users add other people to their friends' list unless they met them first. This prevents many dangerous things which are rather popular on other social medias such as cyber bullying

2. It has a strict sign-up process designed in such a way as to avoid identity thief and fraud as much as possible

3. It offers a points system which encourages people to socially interact thus balancing the use of technology with their mental wellbeing

## SWOT analysis

- **Strengths**

  - Intuitive and easy-to-use schedule/calendar organiser
  - Matching algorithm developed in such a way that no major effort is required from the users for it to match people
  - Strong focus on the users' security while they are using the services provided by the application
  - Niche user base

- **Weaknesses**

  - Aging customers
  - Time consuming sign-up process
  - Available only on mobile devices

- **Opportunities**

  - Create business opportunities for private businesses
  - Help the local government promote public local businesses
  - There will never be a shortage of university students
  - Add more sources of revenue
  - People always strive to find happiness and positive wellbeing. The application supports people to overcome their fears and break out of their comfort zone (regarding social interactions)
  - Number of users who access social media platforms via mobile devices are constantly increasing

- **Threats**

  - Just a start-up reputation
  - A small change in the focus of a large competitor might wipe out any market position the application achieves
  - Really unbalanced cash flow if businesses don't want to promote their venues/events using the application
  - High probability of working with inaccurate data (users may forget to update data such as their schedule or their personal information thus causing inaccuracies in the matching algorithm)
